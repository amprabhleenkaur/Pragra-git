1. We review code using pull request. Once reviewed and approved, it is released, staged and
committed to main branch.
2. We create a branch using git branch branchName
3. To switch to that branch we do, git switch/checkout branchName
4. To know all the branches, do git branch
5. To create and switch to new branch, we do git checkout -b branchName
6. To see working of different branches, we have to commit them first.
7. To delete a branch, we do git branch -d branchName but make sure we are already on a 
different branch while deleting the other branch.
