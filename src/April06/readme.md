1. Class is just a logical entity. It doesn't store data. Objects store data.
2. In Java 8, inside the class it is a method, outside a class it is a function.
3. The method signature has parameters, method caller has arguments.
4. Default values to the variables are provided by the constructor.

7. The parameterised constructor can be called from another constructor using this(arg1, arg2, ...).
